# swarm-verification-lab
Distributed swarm lab exploring MQTT and ROS 2 verification.

This repository explores distributed robot communication using lightweight protocols (MQTT) and robotic middleware (ROS 2).
It simulates and implements a swarm of Raspberry Pi devices that monitor network activity, report findings to a central manager, and verify events collaboratively.
The goal is to understand swarm coordination, event verification, and fault tolerance — topics relevant to multi-robot systems, autonomous manufacturing, and cybersecurity monitoring.
